# AI Tutor Platform 

**Goal:** Personalized coding challenges for kids, with progress tracking.  
**Stack:** Next.js (or minimal Node demo), API routes, tests, CI.

> To keep this starter portable in a single zip, this folder contains a minimal Node/Express prototype.
> You can migrate to Next.js easily later.

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
